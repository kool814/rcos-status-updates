## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week he I worked on the presentation slides for our presentation this upcoming week. I created an interactive demo that can be run from the terminal and will continously accept article titles from the user and run the ml model to determine the clickbaited-ness.

## This Week's Plan

> Other than practicing for the presentation, I'm going to review Kevin's code (my partner) and see if we can fully intergrate our flask application before our presentation.
