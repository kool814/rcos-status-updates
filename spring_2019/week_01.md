## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I set up the project on Github and made sure we had everything correct configured (i.e. License, readme, etc.). \
> Since this is our first semester working on the project, I made sure to completely follow the instructions online to set up \
> the project according to the RCOS standards. \
> I also did some research on current nlp clickbait detection methods and read (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7877426/metrics#metrics) \
> this research paper on a deep learning method to detect clickbait titles from news sources like Huffington Post and other listicles. \
> I also tried to look for a data set to use as training data for our project and found an open source facebook-post scraper that we \
> could use as a standardized training set for our project.

## This Week's Plan

> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to add accessibility features to the user creation dialog box. \
> I also plan on attending the git workshop this week.

> This week I plan to continue exploring the facebook-post scraper as well as look for other sources of potential data sets. \
> I'm also currently reviewing my teammate's, Kevin, code that creates a chrome extension with a few starter buttons that we can configure.

## Anything Blocking?

> Right now I don't have any blockers or any areas where I need external help.
