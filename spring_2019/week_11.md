## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week we had our presentation which went great. We were able to demo our backend ml model and run some sample news titles and show in real time the results of the clickbait.

## This Week's Plan

> This week I'm going to continue reviewing the flask code that we couldn't finish before the presentation and hopefully write the framework for some api's. I'm also going to be preoccupied with studing for some final exams for this week/next week.
