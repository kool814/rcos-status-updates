## Final Update on the Semester:

> This semester was the first semeseter the clickbait chrome extension project was created and worked on. 

> Because it was our first semester working on this project we decided to have few short-term goals for this semester as well as a few long-term goals (around a year/year and a half timeframe)

> For this semester we split up the work amongst Kevin, my partner, and I. Kevin would write the frontend application of the chrome extension which includes setting up the UI of the extension, scraping the front-end news sources for article titles and writing an API to pass the articles to our backend model. I was in charge of the back-end side of things such as collection and cleaning data for our model, writing the Naive Bayes ML model that would classify texts as clickbait or as news, and creating an interactive shell for the model as a demo for the presentation at the end of the semester.

> Our long term goals would be to create a way to parse out images in articles on the front-end and scrape the photogrophers name and date published and match that with the article title, create a color code for the extension that would change colors dynamically as you opened up articles depending on if it was clickbait or not.

> This semester I was able to code up and write all of the back-end tasks which include acquiging data for our model as well as writing the ml model from scratch. On the front-end we were able to finish about half of the tasks which include setting up the chrome extension and parsing the front-end of documents/articles and extracting out the relevant info like titles.

> This project was extremely great and I'm glad I decided to lead and create this project this semester. I was able to do some research on current nlp clickbait detection methods and read some research papers on deep learning methods which was extremely fascinating. I look forward to working on the project for future semesters!
