## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week I started trying to get access to Facebook's post API so that I may get data from different news sources. I finished the questionnaire for requesting access and now I am just waiting to hear a response from FB.

## This Week's Plan

> This week I am planning on trying to look for alternative ways to get post data outside of Facebook.

## Anything Blocking?

> I am currently blocked on trying to get post data from different news sources (from FB)
