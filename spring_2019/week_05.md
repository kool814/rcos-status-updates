## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week I was mainly trying to look for alternative ways to get post data outside of using Facebook's API.
> I found a couple scrapers that scrape news from different sources (CNN, buzzfeed, NYTimes, etc.) that are also open source
so I am going to look at them more closely to figure out which one is the best to use.

## This Week's Plan

> This week I am planning on reading through a couple open source news scrapers on github to try and find an alternative to using Facebook's API
