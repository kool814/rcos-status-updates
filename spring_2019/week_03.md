## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week I continued reading the deep learning research papers on clickbait classifiers: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7877426/metrics#metrics.
> I also reviewed my partner's code and left some comments to review.

## This Week's Plan

> This week I tried to get data from Facebook's post API. Unfortunately it looks like I need to be an active FB developer or have a project that *requires* the use of the internal API's.
> I created a developer account to request access to the API's.

## Anything Blocking?

> I am currently blocked on trying to get post data from different news sources (from FB)
